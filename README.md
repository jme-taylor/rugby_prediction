# Rugby Prediction

This repo contains my attempts to build a machine learning model that can predict the outcome of a rugby match. This is intended as a demonstration in my skills in developing, maintaining and productionising a machine learning model.

It also contains the baseline model setting, exploratory analysis and model training/parameter optimisation. This is so that I can illustrate my approach to training the model. In a production environment, these wouldn't may not be present in the model repository, but stored in version control in a seperate repository.

## Data

All the data is scraped with my custom built [rugby stats scraper](https://github.com/jme-taylor/rugby_stats_scraper).
